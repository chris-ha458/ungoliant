If your server does not have OpenSSL installed and you don't have administrator privileges, install [anacoda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), [install OpenSSL with anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/openssl) and then export these variables:

```bash
export OPENSSL_DIR=/path/to/anaconda/bin
export OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=/path/to/anaconda/lib
export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/anaconda/include
export OPENSSL_STATIC=1
```
